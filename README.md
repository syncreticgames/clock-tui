# clock-tui (`tclock`)

## Syncretic Games Note
clock-tui is the nerve center of my entire dev practice, but I need to keep it as readable as possible. So I'm adding a few small changes to make it easier to configure in its different modes.

## Upstream README

![Clock mode with NERV theme and command widgets](./assets/screenshot-clock-widgets.png)

![Clock mode with Evangelion theme and command widgets](./assets/screenshot-clock-widgets-evangelion.png)

Clock mode supports runtime themes; these screenshots show the built-in `nerv` and `evangelion` themes with command widgets. Press `Shift+T` to cycle `default` → `evangelion` → `nerv`.

`tclock` is a terminal clock app with clock, timer, stopwatch, and countdown modes.

This repository is a maintained fork of the original [`race604/clock-tui`](https://github.com/race604/clock-tui). The original project appears to have been paused for a long time, so this fork keeps the core idea and modernizes it with updated Rust dependencies, GitHub release binaries, AUR packaging, and clock-mode command widgets.

## Install

### Arch Linux / AUR

The recommended install method on Arch Linux is the prebuilt AUR package from this fork:

```shell
yay -S clock-tui-bin
```

### GitHub Releases

Prebuilt Linux binaries are published for `x86_64` and `aarch64`:

<https://github.com/akitaonrails/clock-tui/releases>

Download the tarball for your architecture and put `tclock` somewhere in your `PATH`.

### Build from source

To install this fork directly from GitHub:

```shell
cargo install --git https://github.com/akitaonrails/clock-tui --package clock-tui
```

To build a local checkout:

```shell
cargo build --release
```

The binary will be at `target/release/tclock`.

## Basic usage

```shell
tclock
```

Press `q` to exit. In the main loop, press `c`, `w`, or `t` to switch to clock, stopwatch, or timer mode. Press `Space` to pause/resume modes that support pausing.

Use `--help` for all options:

```shell
tclock --help
tclock clock --help
tclock timer --help
```

### Display options (every mode)

These flags work in every mode, before or after the mode name, and they survive the `c`/`w`/`t` mode switches:

| Flag | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `-T, --title TEXT` | Header above the digits. Timer accepts one title per duration. |
| `-S, --no-seconds` / `--seconds` | Hide or show seconds. Hidden seconds give an `H:MM` display in every mode. |
| `-M, --no-millis` / `-m, --millis` | Hide or show fractional seconds. |
| `-D, --no-date` / `--date` | Hide or show the date line (clock mode). |
| `-P, --paused` | Start paused (timer and stopwatch). |
| `-c, --color`, `-s, --size`, `--theme` | Color, size, and initial theme. |

Precedence, highest first: the flag, the mode's config section, `[default]`, then the mode's built-in default. Built-in defaults: the clock shows the date and seconds; timer and stopwatch show fractional seconds; countdown shows whole seconds.

```shell
tclock stopwatch --title Deep\ work --no-seconds
tclock timer -d 25m 5m -T Focus Break -P
tclock countdown -t 20:00 -T Dinner --no-millis
```

Put the mode name before `--title` when a title has several words, since `--title` takes every following word until the next flag.

## Modes

### Clock

```shell
tclock clock

# The clock is also the default mode:
tclock
```

![clock](./assets/demo-clock-mode.gif)

The clock has one option of its own, the timezone. Everything else comes from the [display options](#display-options-every-mode). A title shares the header line with the date:

```shell
tclock clock --timezone America/New_York
tclock clock --no-seconds
tclock clock --title Study
tclock --color '#e63946'
tclock --size 2
tclock --theme nerv
```

### Timer

```shell
# Start a 5-minute timer
tclock timer --duration 5m
```

Durations can use suffixes such as `s`, `m`, `h`, and `d`. Without `--duration`, the timer uses `[timer] durations` from the config, then 5m. Timer mode can run several durations sequentially and can execute a command when time is up:

```shell
tclock timer --duration 25m 5m --title Focus Break
tclock timer --duration 25m --execute terminal-notifier -title tclock -message "Time is up!"
```

`--execute` falls back to `[timer] execute` from the config. `--paused` starts the timer paused; `--no-millis` hides fractional seconds.

![timer](./assets/demo-timer-mode.gif)

### Stopwatch

```shell
tclock stopwatch
tclock stopwatch --title Lap --no-millis
tclock stopwatch --no-seconds --paused
```

![stopwatch](./assets/demo-stopwatch-mode.gif)

### Countdown

```shell
tclock countdown --time 2026-01-01 --title 'New Year 2026'
```

`--time` accepts values such as `2026-01-01`, `20:00`, `2026-12-25 20:00:00`, or `2026-12-25T20:00:00-04:00`. `-C, --continue` keeps counting past zero, `-r, --reverse` counts up instead.

![countdown](./assets/demo-countdown-mode.gif)

## Configuration

`tclock` reads the first config file it finds in this order:

```text
$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/tclock/config.toml  # when XDG_CONFIG_HOME is absolute
~/.config/tclock/config.toml
<OS-native config dir>/tclock/config.toml
```

The OS-native fallback preserves existing setups, such as
`~/Library/Application Support/tclock/config.toml` on macOS. Duplicate paths
are checked only once.

Missing config is ignored. Invalid TOML prints an error and falls back to defaults.

Example:

```toml
[default]
mode = "clock"
color = "green"
size = 1
# Display keys here apply to every mode unless a mode section overrides them.
show_seconds = true
show_millis = false

[clock]
show_date = true
timezone = "America/Sao_Paulo"

[timer]
durations = ["25m", "5m"]
titles = ["Focus", "Break"]   # one per duration; wins over `title`
repeat = false
show_millis = true
start_paused = false
auto_quit = false
execute = ["notify-send", "Time is up"]

[stopwatch]
title = "Lap"
show_millis = false

[countdown]
time = "20:00"
title = "Dinner"
continue_on_zero = false
reverse = false
```

The display keys `title`, `show_date`, `show_seconds`, `show_millis`, and `start_paused` are accepted under `[default]` and under every mode section. A mode section wins over `[default]`; a command-line flag wins over both. Keys that a mode cannot use (`show_date` outside the clock, `start_paused` outside timer and stopwatch) are ignored.

## Clock widgets

Clock mode can display command widgets below the clock. A widget runs a command, captures its output, renders ANSI colors/styles, and refreshes independently.

Widgets are useful for small status panels: GitHub pending work, calendars, system stats, reminders, CI state, or any command that prints useful text and exits.

The clock automatically sizes itself into the top area when widgets are configured, and the bottom area shows up to 2 widgets on square-ish terminals, 4 on wide terminals, and 6 on ultra-wide terminals.

Widgets with `position = "bottom"` are placed in a full-width band beneath the widget row instead, stacked in config order and each sized to exactly fit its output. The widget row keeps a minimum height when both are present, and a bottom widget that cannot get at least 3 rows is hidden rather than squeezed. Bottom widgets don't count against the per-row widget limits, so a status strip can coexist with a full row of columns.

When a widget has more output than fits on screen, scroll it with the mouse wheel over that widget. `Home` and `End` jump the active widget to the top or bottom. In clock mode, press `Shift+T` to cycle the configured clock theme; lowercase `t` still switches to Timer mode. Press `g` to cycle widget groups (see [Widget groups](#widget-groups)). Press `z` to toggle a clock-only layout that hides every widget and centers the clock in the full terminal; press `z` again to restore the previous widget/group layout. Hidden widgets do not refresh. Widgets can also contribute key-bound popup actions.

Each widget supports:

- `title`: optional display title; omit it to fall back to the command name, or set it to an empty string (`title = ""`) to suppress the title line entirely so the command output owns the whole widget (useful for self-rendered headers)
- `command`: executable string, or array form with arguments
- `refresh_secs`: refresh interval, default `900`
- `timeout_secs`: command timeout, default `30`
- `position`: `"auto"` (default, widget row) or `"bottom"` (full-width band below the row, sized to content)
- `group`: optional group name; widgets in the same group are shown together and swapped as a set with `g` (see [Widget groups](#widget-groups))
- `popup_actions`: optional key bindings that run a command and show its output over the clock

`widget_themes` controls the clock-mode theme cycle. For built-in app palettes (`default`, `evangelion`, and `nerv`), the app themes the clock digits, date/header text, and widget base/chrome styles itself, and also injects the current theme name into every widget subprocess as `TCLOCK_WIDGET_THEME`. `tclock --theme nerv` or `TCLOCK_WIDGET_THEME=nerv tclock` chooses the initial theme and keeps the configured cycle order after it. Other names are still passed to widget commands, but the app UI falls back to default styling unless that palette is added to `tclock` too. Theme names are a contract between your config and the widget commands: a command must understand the name it receives if it wants to match its internal ANSI palette.

```toml
[clock]
widget_themes = ["default", "evangelion", "nerv"]
```

An empty or single-item list makes `Shift+T` harmless. For coherent app + bundled-widget theming, keep built-in names such as `default`, `evangelion`, and `nerv` unless you also add the palette to both `tclock` and `tclock-system-health`.

### Widget popup actions

A widget can bind any single character except the reserved quit key `q` to a popup command. The action reruns the widget command by default and appends `args`, which lets one executable provide both its compact status and its detailed view. Set `command` on the action to run a different executable instead. Action commands receive the current `TCLOCK_WIDGET_THEME` just like normal refreshes.

```toml
[[clock.widgets]]
title = "Service monitor"
command = "service-monitor"
refresh_secs = 300

[[clock.widgets.popup_actions]]
key = "d"
label = "details"       # added to the generated popup title
args = ["--details"]    # appended to service-monitor
# title = "Services"    # optional complete popup-title override
# command = ["journalctl", "--user", "-p", "warning"] # optional replacement
# timeout_secs = 45     # optional; otherwise inherits the widget timeout
```

The binding is active only while its widget is visible. If visible widgets share a key, the last widget scrolled with the mouse wins; otherwise the first matching widget in config order does. Widget actions take precedence over the clock's mode-switch keys when deliberately assigned the same character. Inside a popup, use the mouse wheel, arrow keys, `PageUp`/`PageDown`, `Home`, or `End` to scroll, and `Esc` to close it.

### Widget groups

Screen space is finite, and the widget row only fits 2–6 columns depending on terminal width. Groups let you configure more widgets than fit at once and swap between them: give widgets a `group` name, and press `g` to cycle to the next group.

- A widget with **no** `group` is always on screen, in every group.
- A widget **with** a `group` is only on screen while that group is active.
- Groups cycle in the order they first appear in the config, so **the first grouped widget decides which group is shown at startup**.
- Switching groups keeps each widget's last output, so returning to a group is instant instead of showing `Loading...`. Hidden widgets don't refresh, so an expensive command costs nothing while it's off screen.
- With fewer than two groups, `g` does nothing.

```toml
[clock]
show_date = true

# Always visible — has no group, so it survives every `g` press.
[[clock.widgets]]
title = "Google Calendar"
command = "google-calendar-tui"
refresh_secs = 3600

# Group "weather" appears first, so it's the group shown at startup.
[[clock.widgets]]
title = "Weather"
group = "weather"
command = ["sh", "-c", "curl -s 'https://wttr.in/Florianopolis?0&Q&M'"]
refresh_secs = 1800

# Press `g` to swap the weather column out for this one.
[[clock.widgets]]
title = "GitHub pending"
group = "github"
command = "ghpending"
refresh_secs = 900
```

To show a different region, change the location in the `wttr.in` URL — it accepts a city (`wttr.in/Curitiba`), a city with country when the name is ambiguous (`wttr.in/Porto+Alegre,BR`), an airport code (`wttr.in/GRU`), or `~` for a landmark (`wttr.in/~Cristo+Redentor`). Use `+` for spaces and drop accents. The query flags: `0` prints today only (keeping the widget short), `Q` hides the location header, `M` reports wind in m/s. Don't add `T` — it strips the ANSI colors that the widget would otherwise render. Leaving the location out entirely (`wttr.in/?0`) geolocates by IP, which behind a VPN reports the VPN's exit city.

### Bundled example: system-health widget

The repo ships a ready-to-use widget at [`examples/widgets/tclock-system-health`](./examples/widgets/tclock-system-health). The AUR package installs it as `/usr/bin/tclock-system-health`; release tarballs include it beside `tclock`, so manual installs can extract it to `~/.local/bin` or copy it to `/usr/local/bin`. It renders a two-column health dashboard with a one-line verdict header: backup/cleanup timer freshness, timeshift snapshots, live system/jobs/storage state, and a full-width btrfs row (scrub age per filesystem, fstrim age, allocation pressure, device I/O error counters) — all without root. A failed automount whose paired mount has recovered is shown as a retained warning instead of a live failure. Low Btrfs device-unallocated space is reported as a separate allocation problem only while the filesystem still has ordinary free space; when the filesystem itself is nearly full, the storage alert remains the actionable diagnosis.

Run it with no arguments and it auto-detects common setups (backup-looking user timers with staleness derived from each timer's own period, timeshift via grub-btrfs, btrfs rows only when btrfs is mounted, removable media excluded). Host-specific tuning is plain flags — see `tclock-system-health --help`. The intended pattern is a tiny wrapper script on your PATH holding your host's flags, referenced from the widget config:

The widget supports named color themes, including `default`, the original purple/lavender `evangelion` theme, and the screenshot-inspired red/amber/green `nerv` theme. It honors `TCLOCK_WIDGET_THEME`, so it works with `Shift+T` without a wrapper; an explicit `--theme` or `TCLOCK_SYSTEM_HEALTH_THEME` still wins. See [System-health widget themes](./docs/widget-themes.md) for usage and contributor notes. Packaged installs also include this guide as `/usr/share/doc/clock-tui/widget-themes.md`.

```toml
[[clock.widgets]]
title = ""                    # the script renders its own title+verdict line
command = "my-system-health"  # your wrapper around tclock-system-health
refresh_secs = 300
position = "bottom"

[[clock.widgets.popup_actions]]
key = "d"
label = "details"
args = ["--details"]
```

Example wrapper using the NERV theme:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
exec tclock-system-health --theme nerv "$@"
```

Press `d` while the widget is visible to open the details popup. It starts with a **Flagged** list — every warning or critical finding behind the dashboard verdict, worst first, tagged with the row it came from — followed by sections for failed or retained units and unsuccessful timer jobs, system state (zombie processes with their parents, load, memory), Timeshift snapshots, scheduled jobs, storage, and Btrfs allocation and I/O state. Storage details include exact used/free values and a three-second, best-effort scan of the largest readable child directories for filesystems over the warning threshold. The command is read-only: it never resets units, deletes files, or runs a balance (it only prints the commands you could run). `Esc` closes the popup.

### Screenshot example

The screenshot at the top uses the current local config from this fork, with three widget commands:

- [`ghpending`](https://github.com/akitaonrails/ghpending) for GitHub pending tasks
- [`google-calendar-tui`](https://github.com/akitaonrails/google-calendar-tui) for Google Calendar agenda output
- `tclock-system-health` as a bottom status strip

```toml
[clock]
show_date = true

[[clock.widgets]]
title = "GitHub pending"
command = "ghpending"
refresh_secs = 900

[[clock.widgets]]
title = "Google Calendar"
command = "google-calendar-tui"
refresh_secs = 3600

[[clock.widgets]]
title = ""
command = "tclock-system-health"
refresh_secs = 300
position = "bottom"

[[clock.widgets.popup_actions]]
key = "d"
label = "details"
args = ["--details"]
```

Array commands are supported when you need arguments or a shell wrapper:

```toml
[[clock.widgets]]
title = "GPU"
command = ["nvidia-smi"]
refresh_secs = 60

[[clock.widgets]]
title = "Shell command"
command = ["sh", "-c", "printf 'hello from a widget'"]
```

Widget commands should be finite stdout-producing commands that exit. Long-running alternate-screen TUIs are not a good fit unless they also provide a command or flag that prints a snapshot and exits.

Widget output is intended for compact status text and is capped in memory; very large command outputs are truncated.
